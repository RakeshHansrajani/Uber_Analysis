# Uber Demand and Requests Analysis in Tableau

### Overview
This Tableau project focuses on analyzing Uber's demand and requests data. The dataset used in this project contains information related to Uber ride requests, including the request ID, date, request time, dropoff time, pickup point, driver ID, and ride status. The project aims to provide insights into ride demand patterns and analyze the efficiency of Uber's ride fulfillment process.

### Dataset Parameters
The dataset used in this Tableau project contains the following parameters:
* Request ID: Unique identifier for each ride request
* Date: Date on which the ride request was made
* Request Time: Time at which the ride request was made
* Dropoff Time: Time at which the ride was completed or dropped off
* Pickup Point: Location of the customer's pickup spot
* Driver ID: Unique identification number assigned to the driver
* Status: Status of the ride request (e.g., completed, canceled, in progress)

### Project Goals
The main objectives of this Tableau project are as follows:
1. Analyze the demand for Uber rides over time and identify peak demand hours or days.
2. Visualize the distribution of pickup points to understand popular locations for ride requests.
3. Evaluate the efficiency of Uber's ride fulfillment process by analyzing the time taken to fulfill ride requests.
4. Investigate the ride status distribution to identify the proportion of completed, canceled, or ongoing rides.
5. Identify any patterns or trends related to ride requests and explore their implications for Uber's operations.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
Using Tableau, this project offers a range of interactive visualizations and dashboards to explore and analyze Uber's demand and ride requests. Some of the visualizations and analyses that can be included are:

* Line charts to showcase the demand for Uber rides over time.
* Bar chart visualizations to display the hourly distribution of rides.
* Pie charts to represent the ride status distribution and proportions.
* Interactive filters and parameters to enable users to explore specific time periods, pickup points, or ride statuses.

### Conclusion
The Uber Demand and Requests Analysis project in Tableau provides valuable insights into ride demand patterns and ride fulfillment efficiency. By visualizing and analyzing the dataset parameters, this project aims to help Uber and its stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize their operations, improve customer experience, and enhance the efficiency of their ride fulfillment process.
